## How iloveAgents Keeps Your API Key Safe

iloveAgents works on a simple principle — your API key never leaves your browser.

Here is exactly what happens:
- You paste your API key into the app
- The app sends your request directly to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google — no middleman
- Your key is never saved anywhere — not in a database, not in cookies, not in localStorage
- There is no backend server that could ever see your key
- There is no analytics or tracking of any kind

If you want to verify this yourself, the two files that handle your key are:
- `src/lib/llmAdapter.js`
- `src/lib/useApiKey.js`

Both are short and easy to read.

## Note for Contributors

If you are contributing code, please do not add anything that:
- Sends data to a third-party service
- Logs or stores the API key anywhere
- Adds analytics or tracking scripts

Any PR that does this will be closed, even if it was not intentional.
